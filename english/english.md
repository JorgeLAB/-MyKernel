[Humble - Lamar ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvTRZJ-4EyI&ab_channel=KendrickLamarVEVO)- [Letters - humble](https://www.letras.mus.br/kendrick-lamar/humble/traducao.html)

- "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone first <span style="color: red">came out</span> in 1997."
- The plane <span style="color: red"> took off </span> an hour late.

*Structure*

​	`"Verb + particle"` => it is able to be adverb or preposition. ( Phrasal Verbs )

​	( Translate later ) => Essa estrutura é composta de verbo e particula que tem o sentido totalmente diferente se os tratarmos isoladamente. Bem, no caso de `came out` temos a ideia de lançamento ou publicação e de `take off` de decolagem, mas o verbo `came` e ` took` tem sentidos diferentes isoladamente.

Examples:

- We <span style="color: red">ran</span> the park.
- He <span style="color: red">ran away</span> from home. ( The sense was change.)
- Particles => about, an, on, up, down 

### Order and position in the phrase

#### Transitive and intransitive

Examples 

- He <span style="color:red">took off</span> his jacket. ( It is a _transitive_ phrase verb.) "Took off" should have a complement or object. 
- The plane <span style="color:red">took off</span>. (It is a _intransitive_ phrase verb.)

OBS: Phrase verbs was not common in the formal texts.

### Transitive / Position

1. Please, <span style="color: red">turn on</span> <span style="color: green">the light</span>. The phrase verb is "turn on" and the object is "the light".
2. Please, <span style="color:red">turn</span> <span style="color: green">the light</span> <span style="color: red">on</span>. The verb is "turn", "the light" is the object and "on" is the particle.

If you want to use phrase verbs, you have to attention something like the presence of the personal pronouns. When you have personal pronoun you must to use the structure two with the **"verb" + "pronoun" + "particle"**. 

Example:

- Don't **let** <span style="color:red">me</span> **down**.
- I can't <span style="color:red">lift</span> you <span style="color:red">up</span>. You are too big now.

When your object is other something, difference that a personal pronouns, you can use the first structure.

### A three-word verb

-  **Verb** + **particle** + **preposition**

Example:

- We are <span style="color:red">looking forward to</span> meeting you on the 22nd. 

  Others: 

  - watch out for;
  - get away with; (How to **Get Away with** Murder)
  - keep up with;

# Musics

## Wonderwall - Oasis

Today is gonna be the day 
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

Backbeat, the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I'd
Like to say to you, but I don't know how

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I'd
Like to say to you, but I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (that saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (that saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (that saves me)
