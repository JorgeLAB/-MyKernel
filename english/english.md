## Phrasal Verbs

- "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone first <span style="color: red">came out</span> in 1997."
- The plane <span style="color: red"> took off </span> an hour late.

*Structure*

​	`"Verb + particle"` => it is able to be adverb or preposition. ( Phrasal Verbs )

​	( Translate later ) => Essa estrutura é composta de verbo e particula que tem o sentido totalmente diferente se os tratarmos isoladamente. Bem, no caso de `came out` temos a ideia de lançamento ou publicação e de `take off` de decolagem, mas o verbo `came` e ` took` tem sentidos diferentes isoladamente.

Examples:

- We <span style="color: red">ran</span> the park.
- He <span style="color: red">ran away</span> from home. ( The sense was change.)
- Particles => about, an, on, up, down 

### Order and position in the phrase

#### Transitive and intransitive

Examples 

- He <span style="color:red">took off</span> his jacket. ( It is a _transitive_ phrase verb.) "Took off" should have a complement or object. 
- The plane <span style="color:red">took off</span>. (It is a _intransitive_ phrase verb.)

OBS: Phrase verbs was not common in the formal texts.

### Transitive / Position

1. Please, <span style="color: red">turn on</span> <span style="color: green">the light</span>. The phrase verb is "turn on" and the object is "the light".
2. Please, <span style="color:red">turn</span> <span style="color: green">the light</span> <span style="color: red">on</span>. The verb is "turn", "the light" is the object and "on" is the particle.

If you want to use phrase verbs, you have to attention something like the presence of the personal pronouns. When you have personal pronoun you must to use the structure two with the **"verb" + "pronoun" + "particle"**. 

Example:

- Don't **let** <span style="color:red">me</span> **down**.
- I can't <span style="color:red">lift</span> you <span style="color:red">up</span>. You are too big now.

When your object is other something, difference that a personal pronouns, you can use the first structure.

### A three-word verb

-  **Verb** + **particle** + **preposition**

Example:

- We are <span style="color:red">looking forward to</span> meeting you on the 22nd.
